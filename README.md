## FAQ

**Can you include the challenge's question in your solution?**

Unfortunately, no since I don't want to violate Coderbyte's [Terms of Use](https://coderbyte.com/terms). My solutions are only meant as a resource to check against your own or just to study from in general! You'll need to pay for Coderbyte to see the questions to their code challenges.

**Do you accept submissions for alternative solutions?**

No, not at this time. I originally intended to use this repo as a way to keep a copy of my solutions I wrote when I ended my Coderbyte subscription. However, since this repo has grown in popularity, if there is more interest to open this repo up and accept alternative solution submissions, I may consider this!
